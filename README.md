# Corewar

Typescript / Javascript implementation of the classic game [corewar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War)

Currently this project contains a redcode parser and core simulator.

In future we hope to include a corewar IDE with debugger, an interactive core simulation and a number of hills. The UI will be provided from this project https://github.com/gareththegeek/corewar-ui

## Getting Started

This project is published to NPM where it is intended to be used as a dependency for UI based projects who wish to use the corewar parser and simulator functionality.

To add it to your UI project, `npm install corewar` and then consume it via an import / require:

`import { corewar } from 'corewar';`

The corewar variable will initialise a new instance of the Api class ready for use.
